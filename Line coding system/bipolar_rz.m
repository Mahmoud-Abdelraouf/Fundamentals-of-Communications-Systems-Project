% BIPOLAR_RZ - Generates a bipolar return-to-zero (RZ) waveform from a binary
% sequence.
%
% Syntax:
% y = bipolar_rz(bits, high_voltage_level, samples_per_bit)
%
% Inputs:
% - bits: A row vector representing the input binary sequence.
% - high_voltage_level: A scalar representing the amplitude of the high 
%   voltage level for a logic high bit.
% - samples_per_bit: A scalar representing the number of samples per bit. 
%   If not specified, its default value is 100.
%
% Outputs:
% - y: A row vector representing the generated bipolar RZ waveform.
%
% Description:
% The bipolar_rz function generates a bipolar return-to-zero (RZ) waveform 
% from a binary sequence. The function accepts three input arguments: bits, 
% which is a row vector representing the input binary sequence; 
% high_voltage_level, which is a scalar representing the amplitude of the 
% high voltage level for a logic high bit; and samples_per_bit, which is a 
% scalar representing the number of samples per bit. If samples_per_bit is
% not specified, its default value is 100.
%
% The function first checks the input arguments and computes the number
% ofsamples in the waveform as the product of the length of the binary 
% sequence and the number of samples per bit. It then creates a vector of 
% zeros with length equal to the number of samples in the waveform.

% The function then computes the pulse width for the RZ pulse as half the 
% number of samples per bit. It also sets two flags, pos_flag and neg_flag,
% to keep track of the polarity of the waveform.

% The function generates the RZ pulse waveform by iterating over the input 
% binary sequence. For each bit in the sequence, if the bit is a logic high 
% bit (i.e., equal to 1), the function sets the amplitude of the waveform 
% to the high_voltage_level for the first half of the bit time, and then 
% sets it to zero for the second half of the bit time. If the bit is a 
% logic low bit (i.e., equal to 0), the function sets the amplitude of the 
% waveform to zero for the entire bit time. The function ensures that the 
% waveform is alternating between positive and negative polarities for 
% consecutive logic high bits.

% The function then creates a new figure and plots the generated waveform 
% on the time axis using the plot function. It sets the axis labels, 
% title, and limits the y-axis to the range [-1.2*high_voltage_level, 
% 1.2*high_voltage_level].

% Finally, the function returns the generated waveform as a row vector.

% Overall, the bipolar_rz function is a useful tool for generating bipolar 
% RZ waveforms from binary sequences. It can be used in various 
% applications, such as in telecommunications, where bipolar RZ is a 
% commonly used encoding scheme for transmitting digital data over long 
% distances. The generated waveform can provide insights into the timing and 
% voltage levels of the transmitted bits and can be used for further analysis
% and processing.

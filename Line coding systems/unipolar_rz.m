% unipolar_rz() generates a unipolar RZ (return to zero) pulse waveform from
% a sequence of binary values (0 or 1).
%
% Usage: signal = unipolar_rz(bits, high_voltage_level, low_voltage_level, samples_per_bit)
%
% Input arguments:
%   bits - A vector of binary values (0 or 1) representing the sequence of
%          bits to be encoded into a unipolar RZ signal.
%   high_voltage_level - The voltage level for a logic high bit.
%   low_voltage_level - The voltage level for a logic low bit.
%   samples_per_bit - The number of samples per bit in the generated waveform.
%                     This is an optional argument. The default value is 100.
%
% Output:
%   signal - A vector representing the generated waveform. The waveform is
%            a unipolar RZ pulse waveform with the specified voltage levels and
%            number of samples per bit.
%
% Example usage:
%   % Generate a unipolar RZ signal from a sequence of bits
%   bits = [1 0 1 0 1];
%   high_voltage_level = 3;
%   low_voltage_level = 0;
%   samples_per_bit = 100;
%   signal = unipolar_rz(bits, high_voltage_level, low_voltage_level, samples_per_bit);
%
% The `unipolar_rz()` function generates a unipolar RZ pulse waveform by computing
% the pulse width based on the `samples_per_bit` input argument. The function then
% iterates over each bit in the binary sequence and sets the amplitude of the
% waveform accordingly. For a logic high bit, the amplitude is set to `high_voltage_level`
% for the first half of the pulse and 0 for the second half. For a logic low bit,
% the amplitude is set to 0 for the entire duration of the bit.
%
% The generated waveform is returned as a vector of voltage samples, and it
% is also plotted using the `plot()` function within the `unipolar_rz()`
% function. The `axis()` function is used to set the axis limits based on
% the voltage levels. The function also adds grid and labels to the plot.
%
% The `samples_per_bit` argument is optional and has a default value of 100.
% If `samples_per_bit` is not provided, the default value will be used.
%
% In the example usage, the function is called with a vector of binary bits, and
% the high and low voltage levels are specified. The number of samples per bit
% is also provided, but this is optional. The generated waveform is plotted
% using the `plot()` function within the `unipolar_rz()` function, and it is also returned as the output of the function.
